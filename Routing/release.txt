updated:
update mac scheduler, allocate time slots to links (assume time slot=1ms) every seconds
make sure each packet transfer to proper dest by implementing routing table
improve multicast functions: packet duplicate, packet tranfer
new mobility data 
specifiy node searching area (only send MAC msg to nodes inside particular halo) for halo configuration
realization multicast
sender generate pkt when it can send pkt (timeout funtion)
halo should consume less time on searching its neighbor
halo provide more stable route, better select node belongs to last time (check connectivity) o.w. choose members in previous halo



updating:
we still need to test directional antenna parts on halo
each neighbor should have one queue
directional minimum spanning tree
antenna switching
build directional routing table
correct phantom id issue: I got 2 phantom.id==2
MAC link should hold while transmission is happening, queue.busy==0 if delta_t > transmission time. Now it changes state
in every sampling period (10ms). (CSMA)
